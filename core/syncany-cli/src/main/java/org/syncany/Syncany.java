/**
 * Syncany is an open-source cloud storage and filesharing application. It allows
 * users to backup and share certain folders of their workstations using any kind
 * of storage, e.g. FTP, Amazon S3 or Google Storage.
 * 
 * While the basic idea is similar to Dropbox and JungleDisk, Syncany is open-source
 * and additionally provides data encryption and more flexibility in terms of storage
 * type and provider:
 * 
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Data encryption:</b> Syncany encrypts the files locally, so that any online storage
 *       can be used even for sensitive data.</li>
 *   <li><b>Arbitrary storage:</b> Syncany uses a plug-in based storage system. It can be used
 *       with any type of remote storage.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>The Syncany class is the central entry point for the command line client and
 * the only class to expose a main method. It does not offer any functionality
 * on its own, but rather just instantiates a {@link CommandLineClient} and passes
 * the command line arguments to it.  
 * 
 * <p>Many thanks to all the people who have supported the project over the years and who have
 * continued to listen to my constant never-ending Syncany talk! Thank you all!
