	 * Deletes a file locally and/or creates a conflicting file if the
	 * file does not match the expectations. There are two major cases:
	 * 
	 * <p>Normal case: The file version of the to-be-deleted file is known. If the file is 
	 * as expected, it is deleted; if not and the file exists, a conflict file is created.
	 * 
	 * <p>Special case: The file version of the to-be-deleted file in unknown. 
	 * In case to-be-deleted-file exists locally, we need to compare it to
	 * the local file (especially its checksum!). The {@link FileVersionComparator}
	 * does, however, perform a cancelling test in which {@link FileVersion}s marked as
	 * 'DELETED' are not compared in detail (no checksum/attribute/etc. comparisons). To
	 * circumvent this behavior, we pretend the file has just changed and do the comparison.
	 * If the to-be-deleted file and file version are equal, the local file is deleted. 
	 * Otherwise, a conflict file is created.
