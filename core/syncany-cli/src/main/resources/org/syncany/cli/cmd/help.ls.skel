NAME
  sy-ls - lists and filters the current and past file tree
   
SYNOPSIS
  sy ls [-V | --versions] [-t | --types=<types>] [-D | --date=<date>]
        [-r | --recursive] [-f | --full-checksums] [-g | --group]
        [-H | --file-history] [-q | --deleted] [<path-expression>]
  
DESCRIPTION 
  This command lists and filters the file tree based on the local database. 
  The file tree selection can be performed using the following selection
  criteria: 
  
  (1) Using the <path-expression>, one can select a file pattern (such as
  `*.txt`) or sub tree (such as `subfolder/`, only with -r). (2) Using -r,
  the command does not only list the folder relative to the 
  <path-expression>, but to all sub trees of it. (3)  The -t option limits
  the result set to a certain file type ('f' for files, 'd' for directories,
  and 's' for symlinks). Types can be combined, e.g. `sy ls -tfs` selects
  files and symlinks. (4) The -D option selects the date/time at which to
  select the file tree, e.g. `sy ls -D20m` to select the file tree 20 minutes
  ago or `sy ls -D2014-05-02` to select the file tree at May 2. (5) The -H
  option can be used to select a specific file only. If the option is given,
  the <path-expression> is interpreted as a file history identifier. (6) The
  -q flag will display files that have been deleted from the file system.
  
  Using the --versions flag, the command also displays the entire version 
  history for the selected files. Using --group, the result can be grouped by
  the file history identifier.  
  
OPTIONS
  -V, --versions
    Select and display the entire history of the matching files instead of only
    the last version. Useful with --group.
  
  -t, --types=<t|d|s>            
    Limits the result set to a certain file type ('f' for files, 'd' for
    directories, and 's' for symlinks). Types can be combined, e.g. 
    `sy ls -tfs` selects files and symlinks. Default setting is 'tds'. 
     
  -D, --date=<relative-date|absolute-date>
    Selects the file tree at a certain date. The date can be given as a 
    relative date to the current time, or an absolute date in form of a 
    timestamp.
    
    Absolute date format: <yy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss>

    Relative date format: <value><unit>, for which <value> may be any 
    floating point number and <unit> may be any of the following: s(econds),
    m(inutes), h(ours), d(ays), w(eeks), mo(nths), y(ears). Units may be
    shortened if they are unique. Examples: 5h30m or 1y1mo2d
        
  -H, --file-history
    If the option is given, the <path-expression> is interpreted as a file
    history identifier. This option can be used to select one specific
    file history. If -H is given, -V is automatically switched on.
 
  -r, --recursive
    Not only selects the folder relative to the <path-expression>, but to all
    sub trees of it.
    
  -q, --deleted
    Also selects files that have been deleted from the file system, but are
    still kept in the database. These files can be restored using the
    `sy restore` command. By default, deleted files are not displayed.
    
  -g, --group
    Only works with --versions. Displays the file versions grouped by file
    history.
  
  -f, --full-checksums
    Displays full/long checksums instead of shortened checksums.    
    
  <path-expression>
    Selects a file pattern or sub tree of the database using substring and 
    wildcard mechanisms. The expression is applied to the relative slash-
    separated path. The only possible wildcard is * (equivalent: ^).
    
    If <path-expression> does not contain a wildcard, it is interpreted as
    prefix and extended to `<path-expression>*`. If a wildcard is present, no
    wildcard is appended.
    
    Note: The Linux shell expands the * wildcard if a matching file is
    present. Either use single quotes (e.g. '*.txt') or use ^ instead.
    
EXAMPLES   
  sy ls -r subfolder/
    Selects all file entries of the current file tree in the folder
    'subfolder/', including for instance 'subfolder/some/other/file.txt'.
    
  sy ls --recursive --types=fs --date=1h30m '*.txt'
    Selects all files and symlinks in the entire file tree that end with .txt
    and existed one and 30 minutes hour ago. 
    
  sy ls --versions --group --recursive
    Selects and displays all file versions and their file histories. 
    This selects the entire database. Use with caution.
