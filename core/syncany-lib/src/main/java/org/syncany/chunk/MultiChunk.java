/**
 * A multichunk represents the container format that stores one to many {@link Chunk}s.
 * Multichunks are created during the chunking/deduplication process by a {@link MultiChunker}.
 *
 * <p>There are two modes to handle multichunks:
 *
 * <ul>
 *  <li>When a new multichunk is <i>written</i> and filled up with chunks, the {@link Deduper} makes sure that
 *      chunks are only added until a multichunk's minimum size has been reached, and closes the
 *      multichunk afterwards. During that process, the {@link #write(Chunk) write()} method is called
 *      for each chunk, and {@link #isFull()} is checked for the size.
 *
 *  <li>When a multichunk is <i>read</i> from a file or an input stream, it can be processed sequentially using
 *      the {@link #read()} method (not used in current code!), or in a random order using the
 *      {@link #getChunkInputStream(byte[]) getChunkInputStream()} method. Because of the latter method,
 *      <b>it is essential that random read access on a multichunk is possible</b>.
 * </ul>
