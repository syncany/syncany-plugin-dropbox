/**
 * Commands are the central part of Syncany's command line client. Each implementation 
 * of this abstract class represents a command that a user can run on the command line.
 * 
 * <p>The purpose of a command is to read required and optional arguments from the command
 * line, run the corresponding operation, and display the results on the console.
 * Implementations are not supposed to actually run any detailed logic, but are merely
 * the user interface to collection options and print operation output. 
 * 
 * <p>Implementations must implement the {@link #execute(String[]) execute()} method and
 * the {@link #getRequiredCommandScope()} method. While the former actually implements
 * the logic, the latter specifies whether a command must be called inside (or outside) a 
 * local Syncany directory. 
 * 
 * <p>Commands are automatically mapped from their camel case name on the command line
 * to a class name using the {@link CommandFactory}. The command 'ls-remote', for instance,
 * is mapped to the <tt>LsRemoteCommand</tt>.
